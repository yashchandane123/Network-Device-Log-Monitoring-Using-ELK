# Network Device Log Monitoring Using ELK

This project demonstrates how to set up and use the ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack for monitoring network device logs. The ELK stack enables real-time log collection, parsing, indexing, and visualization.

## Explanation

The ELK stack is a widely used solution for log management and analytics. It consists of three main components:

1. **Elasticsearch**: A distributed search and analytics engine used for storing and indexing log data.
2. **Logstash**: A data processing pipeline that ingests logs from various sources, processes them, and sends them to Elasticsearch.
3. **Kibana**: A visualization tool that allows users to explore and analyze log data stored in Elasticsearch.

### Workflow

1. **Log Collection**: Network devices (e.g., routers, switches, firewalls) forward logs to Logstash.
2. **Log Parsing**: Logstash processes the logs using filters to structure and extract meaningful data.
3. **Log Indexing**: Processed logs are indexed in Elasticsearch for efficient storage and retrieval.
4. **Visualization**: Kibana provides dashboards and tools to visualize and analyze the logs.

This setup helps in monitoring, troubleshooting, and gaining insights from network device logs, ensuring better management and security of your network infrastructure.
